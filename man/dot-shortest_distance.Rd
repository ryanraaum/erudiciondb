\title{Calculate minimum Jaro-Winkler distance between name part sequences}
\usage{
.shortest_distance(found_parts, target_parts)
}
\arguments{
\item{found_parts}{Character vector of name parts from search query}

\item{target_parts}{Character vector of name parts from database record}
}
\value{
Numeric: minimum average Jaro-Winkler distance (0 = perfect match, 1 = no match)
}
\description{
Compares two sets of name parts using a sliding window approach to find the
best alignment, returning the minimum average Jaro-Winkler distance.
}
\details{
Algorithm:
\enumerate{
\item Filter out single-character parts (initials) from both inputs
\item Return 1 (no match) if either input becomes empty after filtering
\item If found_parts has one element, return minimum distance to any target part
\item Use sliding window to compare found_parts to successive subsets of target_parts
\item Return minimum average distance across all alignments
}

The sliding window handles cases where names have different numbers of parts
(e.g., "Jean Paul Smith" vs "Jean Smith") by finding the best substring match.
}
\note{
Used by \code{.name_distance()} for fuzzy person name matching. Single-character
filtering ensures initials don't dominate the distance calculation.
