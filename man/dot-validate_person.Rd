Validation rules:
\enumerate{
\item At least one of primary_given_names, other_given_names, or surnames must be present
\item If present and not NA/NULL, name fields must be character type
}

Throws descriptive errors for:
\itemize{
\item Missing all name fields: "no core name entered"

}
}
\note{
This is the only validator currently implemented. Other object types pass
through without validation (validators list entry is NULL).
