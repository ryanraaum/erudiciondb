\title{Find items associated with a focal person}
\usage{
.find_item_by_person(connection, person_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{Database connection or pool}

\item{person_id}{UUID of the focal person to search for}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns: item_id, stage, revision, similarity (1), found_by ("person_id")
}
\description{
Searches for all items that have a specific focal person as a creator/contributor,
by joining through personlists and item_persons tables.
}
\details{
Performs a three-way join to find items linked to a person:
\enumerate{
\item items LEFT JOIN personlists (one item can have multiple personlists)
\item LEFT JOIN item_persons (each personlist entry links to a person)
\item Filter where person_id matches the search value
\item Return unique item_ids with full item data
}

This allows finding items where a focal person is listed as an author, editor,
or any other creator role.
}
\note{
This is the fourth search strategy in \code{.find()} for items. Only searches for
focal persons (those in the persons table), not all item_persons.
