\title{Calculate Jaro-Winkler distance between a name and multiple target names}
\usage{
.name_distance(found_name, target_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{found_name}{Character string: single name from search query}

\item{target_names}{Character vector: names from database to compare against}
}
\value{
Numeric vector: distance for each target name (0 = perfect, 1 = no match)
}
\description{
Vectorized wrapper around \code{.shortest_distance()} that compares one search name
to multiple database names, splitting into parts and finding best alignments.
}
\details{
For each target name:
\enumerate{
\item Split both names into parts using \code{.name_parts()}
\item Calculate minimum distance using \code{.shortest_distance()} sliding window
\item Return vector of distances aligned with target_names
}

Used in \code{.match_person()} for approximate name matching (4th strategy).
Threshold for match: distance < 0.05 for both given and family names.
