\title{Find items by fuzzy title matching}
\usage{
.find_item_by_title(connection, title)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{Database connection or pool}

\item{title}{Title string to search for}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns: item_id, stage, revision, similarity, found_by
}
\description{
Searches for items with similar titles using Jaro-Winkler similarity metric,
with different implementations for SQLite (R-based) vs DuckDB (SQL-based).
}
\details{
Uses Jaro-Winkler similarity to find fuzzy title matches:
\itemize{
\item Compares lowercased search title to substring of database titles (same length)
\item \strong{SQLite}: Pulls all items and computes similarity in R using stringdist package
\item \strong{DuckDB}: Uses SQL \code{jaro_winkler_similarity()} function with WHERE filter
\item Threshold: similarity ≥ 0.9 (only for DuckDB; SQLite returns all, caller filters)
}

The substring comparison ensures we're comparing equal-length strings, which
is important for Jaro-Winkler accuracy.
}
\note{
SQLite version pulls entire items table into memory for similarity calculation,
which may be slow for large databases. DuckDB version is more efficient as it
filters in the database. Both return found_by = "title".
